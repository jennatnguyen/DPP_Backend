# Doctor Patient Portal

This web application provides a platform for managing doctor-patient appointments. Patients are able to seamlessly chat with doctors and create and view meal plans. Additionally doctors are able to assign meal plans as well as presciptions to patients. Pharmacists may manage prescriptions and requests made by those doctors in a dashboard. On both ends users are able to access a social media like page to view recipes and meals to add to their meal plans. This web app was made with a variety of tools (e.g., React frontend, Flask backend, MySQL database, deployed on Render and Azure).

## Running the Backend:

- Make sure you create a virtual environment by running the following commands (I used the PowerShell Terminal):
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

- Then, install the needed libraries through the requirements.txt file: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the File:
python server.py 

## Deployment
This app is deployed on Render (frontend) and Azure (backend).
